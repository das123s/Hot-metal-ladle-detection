Project Name: Hot Metal Ladle Detection
Description: The project "Maitri" is all about "Hot Metal Ladle Detection By Using Analog Cameras & DVR". So I have used Machine Learning as a techinque & Python as a programming language. I have created a custom dataset & trained the whole model through it. Finally model achieved 90-95% accuracy. Basically this project has two parts:
1.Object Detection: Atfirst when we go to the "Object Detection" folder, a .yaml file is there & if we run the code through our Google Colab or Colab Notebook then the model has been generated & then we have to upload the custom dataset to it followed by a pre trained CCTV footage. Thus the model will easily detect the Ladle with more than 90% confidence & the engine will indicate as a "Engine" and the rest of the vessels will be as a "Ladle".
2.Loading Status: The Ladle contains hot metal from Blust Furance & carried to the SMS shop at SAIL. So I have to create a model along with custom dataset to detect whether the Ladle loaded or not. So I have to create a new dataset & made the model so robust that it can detect the Ladle even at night. This is really very challenging to me on that time. But finally I havde acomplished the project. 
Table Of Contents:
a. How to use Machine Learning libraries very efficiently.
b. Use of Python & which versions are suitable for this project.
c. Learn about various types of Python libraries i.e. OpenCV.
d. How to create a custom dataset according to one's needs.
e. How to train a model.
f. Usage a Google Colab & its run types.
g. Object detection in real life.
h. How to indicate the loading status of a Ladle even at night.
i. Confidence & accuracy index of a model.
j. Efficiently use of conda & command prompt.
k. Knowledge about train data & test data.
l. Relation of epoch to the efficiency. 
Installation:
a. Atfirst we have to install python 3.8.8 & use the libraries in it. 
b. Then we have a PyCharm as an IDE. 
c. Use the Google Colab from Drive.
d. Use AI geerated tools i.e. Lobe for creating a custom dataset.
e. Install Machine Learning libraries for Object Detection.
f. Install Anaconda in the system.
g. Install other depedencies if required at the time of training of the model.
Usage:
a. It is very robust model at plant areas where the minimum man power will be required with better efficiency. 
b. Through this model we can easily detect the Ladle with Ladle number & use it in future as the images stored in a local database.
c. The Ladle carries hot metal & it's loading status has been checked by manually. So it is not a good practice & risky also. So this model reduce this risk, cost with better efficiency.
d. By the help of this the whole process will be automized & it will beneficial to all.
